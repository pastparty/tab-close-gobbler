# Tab Close Gobbler ðŸ¦ƒ

Chrome on Windows has this shortcut to close your current tab: <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd>. 

When you accidentally hit <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>â‡§SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd> you might *or might not* note that the window with all your precious tabs with medium articles you *definetly* want to read is closed. Awey. Gone. Devoured by the void. 

This is bad. 
Because sometimes you tabswitch/windowswitch a lot and don't notice your loss, while your browser history is rewritten by all the new medium articles you are about to read in a few minutes for real. So all the existing fancy rescue and restore windows keyboard shortcuts and menu options are drowning in your browser's personal R'lyeh.

Then dis good gobble boi ðŸ¦ƒ jumps right into your focus. 
Look how handsome it behaves. 
Sits there like a rock against the odds of unmercy browser robots to interupt and prevent you from shooting your tabs into browser history nirvana.
It's a good boi.

Open said [gobble boi ðŸ¦ƒ](http://pastparty.tech/tab-close-gobbler/), pin it, leave it and call it a day.


*Seriously I don't know why I did this but maybe it's usefull somehow.*
